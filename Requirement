Note :

    dedicated_account_adjustment_amount = pcsSubSrvThreshQuota value in case of replica da
     dedicated_account_adjustment_amount =  pcsSubSrvThreshQuota - pcsSrvTotUsedQuota), in case of main da
    DA_ID is based on the pcsServiceElementName and its value will be caputred from the cfg file 

First filter must be on pcsServiceBillResetType = date
second filter is pcsServiceElementName  should be exist (not null)
third:if pcsServiceElementName is not available in the cfg file then don't write the MSISDN record in file output file.

if  pcsServiceID = 110 and 130 for One msisdn

  In this case dedicated_account_adjustment_amount  = (pcsSubSrvThreshQuota - pcsSrvTotUsedQuota) + 130's ( pcsSubSrvThreshQuota - pcsSrvTotUsedQuota)

  And need to create One record  only.
